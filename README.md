# Classfetch

This is a quick react app I threw together to see the classes, even if the admins removed access. This works because the API doesn't get restricted. Nice job classlink devs.


## How it works:

    Ordinarily, you can see your classes from the classlink dashboard, but the Admins decided to disable that. Thankfully, I had the foresight to document how it fetches classes and handles authentication, so with a hacky little userscript, some super simple javascript, and a CORS proxy, I am able to fetch the class list.
